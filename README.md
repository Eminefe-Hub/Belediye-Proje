## What I Learned During This Project

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in database design and management, particularly using MySQLi. I also improved my skills in Laravel framework development, which provided insights into routing, migrations, and controller structures. Implementing smart systems and mobile integration enhanced my understanding of IoT concepts and RESTful API development. Additionally, working with PHPStorm helped streamline my coding workflow.

## Challenges Faced

While working on this project, I faced challenges with integrating real-time features for smart devices, which required research into WebSockets and event broadcasting. Configuring the Laravel environment and resolving dependency issues also proved time-consuming but were ultimately rewarding experiences. Troubleshooting database migrations and adapting to changes in requirements taught me the importance of flexible and scalable design patterns.
